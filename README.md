# Thesis

This project was created for my Bsc Thesis Project at Vienna University of Economics and Business (Wirtschaftsuniversit√§t Wien).
The data for the visualizations was downloaded from https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19, and for the viusalizations I used Mapbix GL JS and A-Frame.

In order to run the code you need to install the requirements and then run the app.py.
